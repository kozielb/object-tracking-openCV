# object-tracking

It is a simple script that tracks objects with the color selected by the left mouse button.
We can either pass a video through the argument or if argument was not passed then video is taken from our camera.
To achieve my goal I used opencv library.
To pause / play again your video just press 'p' character, and if you wanna close it press 'q'.
